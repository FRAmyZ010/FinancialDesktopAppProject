## üîç Concept

The core idea behind this project is to create a personal finance management and tracking tool ‚Äî all in one place.  
It also aims to support recording investment activities, promote financial discipline, and encourage consistent tracking habits.

Additionally, this is my very first solo project.  
If there are any mistakes or oversights, I sincerely apologize and genuinely welcome all feedback and suggestions for improvement.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Please note:**  
> This is only an initial idea, and **many changes may occur** in future development.
